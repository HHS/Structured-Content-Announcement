<h1>Health and Human Services (HHS) Drupal Content Type Library: Announcement</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Announcement content type matches the News Release content type with the exception that it will not appear in the HHS News section of the website. This content type is for use by Offices who wish to post their own press releases within the confines of their site section. Announcements do not appear in the HHS News section. It is structured the same as the News Release content type to match industry standards for press releases.

<h2>Content Type Details</h2>
Contained in the /documentation folder are the content model for the Announcement content type (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-Announcement.xlsx) which includes the Drupal field names used and their matching schema.org metadata name; and a Word Template (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-Template-Announcement.docx) which is a guidance document we provide to content owners to complete whenever they want an Announcement to be created. The Template includes all of the fields that must be completed in order to create the Announcement, as well as a taxonomy list to reference as they fill in those fields that require a taxonomy term.
